# Horizontal Calender - React/TypeScript

Created with CodeSandbox

### Objective:

Make a horizontal calendar component (dates stripe) that can display days of one week and can be navigated back/forth.
The component should be nicely designed, be easy and intuitive to use.
The component should support setting custom day display, active/selected day, and have today highlighted.
